# React-Redux-Course-Treehouse
## React Redux Course - Part of the "Learn React" Track on teamtreehouse.com

### About this Course

Redux is a state management framework that provides a robust infrastructure that complements React applications. This course will build on the Scoreboard application that was developed in the React Basics course.

#### What you'll learn

- Managing application UI state and Logical state
- Understanding pure functions
- Building a stable and predictable client application
- One-way data binding
- Getting Started with Redux

You’ve learned how to build React applications and now you’re ready to learn Redux! To build Redux applications, there are key concepts to learn about first, as well as some initial project setup.

### Modularizing the React Scoreboard Application
Now that you have a project setup with webpack, npm and eslint, the next step is to organize your application into different modules. In this stage, you'll implement a container component and various presentational components. Once you have modularized your components, it will be easier to apply Redux principles to the application.

### Actions, Dispatch, and Reducers. Oh my!
This stage will focus on identifying the actions your application will take and what the application state will look like. This means defining action types, building action creators and breaking the application state into reducers.

### Putting it all Together
It’s time to wire up your application to Redux! By the end of this stage, you'll have a fully functioning React-Redux application with development tools that make troubleshooting and debugging your application easier. Not to mention the modularity of your application will make it easier to track down and resolve issues or scale the application.
